# Cars Listing

Cars Listing Take Home Project for Backend Engineering Mentorship

This is a Django based assignment. We have created a base project for you to work from. You are free to vary from our original base if you would like to. We provide it with the intention of providing a common base for all candidates to work from and to hopefully save you a bit of time.

We encourage you to use the Django Rest Framework for developing your API. This is a framework that we use extensively at Cars listing, and it provides some nice functionality out of the box. [Django Rest Framwork](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/)
